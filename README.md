# Netflix Customer Churn Prediction

A machine learning project to analyze user behavior and predict customer churn for Netflix.  
The project uses the **Netflix userbase dataset** to identify patterns that contribute to customer churn and applies predictive models to estimate churn probability.

## üìå Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Netflix userbase data  
- Identify key features influencing churn (e.g., age, plan type, country, subscription length)  
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for churn prediction  
- Provide insights into churn drivers for potential business actions

## üß™ Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical features (e.g., country, plan type)
   - Scale numerical features (e.g., age, subscription length, monthly revenue)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Distribution plots of demographics and plan usage
   - Correlation analysis between features
   - Visualization of churn vs. non-churn groups

3. **Modeling**
   - Algorithms tested: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM  
   - Data split into training and test sets  
   - Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

4. **Evaluation**
   - Compare model performance
   - Select best-performing model
   - Analyze feature importance

## üìä Results

### EDA Findings
- Certain demographics show higher churn probability  
- Plan type and subscription length are strong churn indicators  

### Model Performance
- Random Forest and SVM achieved the highest F1-scores  
- Feature importance highlighted subscription type, monthly revenue, and tenure as top predictors
